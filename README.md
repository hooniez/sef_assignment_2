This assignment is about evaluating an individual's understanding of software engineering and their ability to apply the main aspects of software engineering, evaluate requirements for a software system, apply the process of analysis and design using the object-oriented approach, and recognize and describe current trends in the area of software engineering. The assessment consists of three activities: creating a new employee categorized as manager, creating a class diagram and transforming it into Java code, and recommending a software architecture for the scenario.

The first activity involves creating a new sequence diagram to address the new requirement of adding a manager employee to the system and explaining the changes made. The second activity involves creating a class diagram and transforming it into Java code. The third activity involves recommending a software architecture for the scenario and providing details to justify the recommendation.
